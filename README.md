# fastapi-planets
Planets implemented with FastAPI Framework

## Usage

`docker compose up -d` 

`http :8000/planets/3`

But the most amazing part about using FastAPI is its integration with API Documentation and a built-in dev portal! Try it: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

Did you know you can add a `build: .` stanza and use `docker compose up -d --build`? Well, you can! Fiddle w/ it here.
